        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: Grew up in NM, then school in DC, grad school in VA, moved to Charlotte for work around '97. CPCC since '01. Seven kids, 4 cats, a fish, and a Gekko...</li>
            <li>Professional: First "legit" job for pay was stacking bricks in the New Mexico desert for $2/hr. Best paid job was $1000 for an hour-long presentation. Lots of stuff in between ranging from movie theater projectionist to intructional developer trainer. Been a community college teacher for since 2001.</li>
            <li>Academic background: BSLA, MS/MIS, lots of training - i mean lots. Worked in everything from Ski Instruction to Movie theaters, but more recently as a consultant and teacher. I do a lot of conference presentations and professional workshops, and teach in a couple of different places along with my full-time work at CPCC. Information/Technology background: Started with macs in early 90's, then on to PC's in grad school, and now just see 'em all as tools. I want them to do the job, and don't care about much else. I see computers as magnifications of possibilities.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I've been using computers since I was in college, and eventually ended up working on a computer store (including selling the software we teach in this class!) and getting a Masters in Management Information Systems. That doubled my salary in one year!</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 7-10 at home and work, though I just got a mac laptop to play with.</li>
            <li>Courses I'm teaching and reason for each: 
                <ul>
                    <li>WEB210 - Web Design - we have to recreate this since the big hack of '21</li>
                    <li>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting - one of my regulars. Mostly JS</li>
                    <li>CIS110 - Introduction to Computers - we have a lot of these sections, so i teach it a lot.</li>
                    <li>ITSC1212 - Introduction to Computer Science 1 (Java) - a core UNCC CS class I've taught twice before</li>
                    <li>ITIS3135 - Web Design & Development - Teaching for the first time at Charlotte, but not new to subject</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                I donated my body to science in school to earn money - in one experiment i got $500 for letting them inject me with radioactive water for a PET scan. I'll always wonder...</li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I'm hoping to make a vlogging channel that covers my adventures as a middle-aged dad.</li>
        </ul>
